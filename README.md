# Data Mining Techniques

### Exercise1 - Sentiment Analysis / Opinion Mining

Given datasets of tweets, the task is to perform the analysis of sentiments and train models (SVM, KNN classifiers) to evaluating tweets and assessing whether their sentiment is **positive, negative or neutral**<br/>

The whole project is presented through the **exercise.ipynb** with good documentation included.<br/>- The directory **twitter_data** contains the training and testing datasets as well as the correct results.<br/>- The directory **lexica** contains lexicon files with words and their "valence" value, obtained from classifiers or machine learning and are used for inserting extra features in the Word Embedding vectors (for more, see the .ipynb file)
